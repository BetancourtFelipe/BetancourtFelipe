After a long career in gastronomy, I discovered my passion for programming through my best friends. 
I completed the UPLEVELED bootcamp for Fullstack web development and have since grown to love the latest technologies. 

Learning and acquiring knowledge is one of the greatest gifts, and I both enjoy giving and receiving gifts.
